A controller is a process that monitors the state of various components within the system and works to bring the whole system to the desired state

node-controller monitors the status of the nodes. Checks nodes every 5s. If it stops receiving a pulse from a node after 40s, then it marks the node as unreachable. After this, it gives it 5m to come back up and if it doesn't then it removes the pods and reassignes them to healthy ones if they are part of a replicaset

replication-controller - montitors replicasets and insures the desired number of pods are always running within the set. Creates new pods if one dies

namespace-controller
deployment-controller
job-controller and many other

all of these concepts (deployments, replicasets etc) are all implemented via a controller

all of these are packaged into a single controller called 'kube-controller-manager'
