If you wanted to add a DNS name for a server on your network add the IP and DNS name into /etc/hosts, for example:

  192.167.4.1    db

If you try to ping 'db' it will resolve to that IP.
This becomes challenging when you have a large number of servers as this file would become very large. If one IP changed you would need to change the IP on each host
So to fix this, move all the entries into one single DNS server where they can all be managed centrally. Point all hosts to look at that server instead of its own /etc/hosts file
Every host has a DNS resolution config file at /etc/resolve.conf. Add an entry specifying the address of the DNS server

  nameserver     192.168.1.100

The host machine will always check its own /etc/hosts file first. If it finds the entry it will use that; if not it will look on the DNS server
But that order can be changed in the file '/etc/nsswitch.conf'. Look for the line like:

  hosts:          files dns

'files' refers to the local /etc/hosts file and 'dns' refers to the DNS server. Swap the order to first look at the DNS server and then at the local hosts file

If you want to connect to something that is not in either file, then you can add another nameserver to /etc/hosts:
  
  nameserver      8.8.8.8

This is a common public nameserver hosted by Google. But again you would need to add this to each host.
Instead add an entry to your DNS server:

  Forward ALL to 8.8.8.8


'nslookup' and 'dig' only query the DNS server. They ignore your '/etc/hosts' file
