'route'  command shows your routing config

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         DESKTOP-2TJA4QI 0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
172.27.32.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 eth0

Destination = default: Any request your computer doesn't know the route should use the router as the default gateway
Gateway = 0.0.0.0: means you don't need to use a gateway because its in its own network
