If you are looking for a HA setup of your etcd cluster then you can have multiple etcd servers. However this will mean writing to etcd becomes more complicated. To avoid any issues a leader is elected

Leader election happens as a result of the RAFT protocol. When a cluster is set up and there are multiple etcd servers, RAFT algorithm starts random timers on each etcd node. The first node who's timer completes will send out a request to the other nodes asking to become leader. The other nodes respond and then it becomes the leader.

It sends out regular notifications that it is still assuming the role of leader. If they don't receive this notification at some time then the election process starts againIf a write comes to a leader node then it sends a copy to a worker. If it comes to any of the workers then the workers forward it to the leader who then processes it. 

A write is only complete once it has been replicated to the MAJORITY of the nodes; so if there are 3 nodes and it writes to 2 then its considered successful (majority/quorum = n/2 + 1). This is why a minimum of 3 is recommended because quorum cannot be achieved with just 2 nodes as 2/2 + 1 = 2. 

With 3 nodes you have a fault tolerance of 1 node. An odd number is recommended as if you have your nodes subnetted and they happen to be divided evenly in the subnets, then you cannot achieve quorum (9:00). If quorum is not achieved then the cluster is non-functional..
