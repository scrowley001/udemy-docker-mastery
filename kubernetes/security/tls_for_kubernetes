How to set up private keys and certificates for encryption between components:
- on the private CA, create a private key. Then create a CSR. As this is for the CA itself this CSR will be self-signed
- on the CA create an admin user key; create a CSR; and then sign it, but this time sign it with the key and cert you created above for the CA. For admins you also need to specify the O parameter with 'system:masters'
- follow a similar process to create client certs for all components that access the kube-apiserver. For kube-scheduler, controller-manager and kube-proxy their name's must be prefixed with 'system:'
- Note: whenever you configure a server or client, you also need to specify the CA route cert so that all components can verify each other

etcd can have its own CA. The etcd server and client certs (client server being on the api-server) will all be signed by the etcd server CA
