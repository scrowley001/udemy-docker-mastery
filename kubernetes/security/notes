By default Docker runs a container with a limited set of capabilities and so the proccesses running in the container don't have the rights to interfere with the host or other containers running on the host. You can override this with the --cap-add or --cap-drow command:
docker run --cap-add MAC_ADMIN ubuntu
docker run --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN ubuntu

Or to run the container with all privilages enabled use:
docker run --privileged ubuntu

pod_security.yml has example in kubernetes
