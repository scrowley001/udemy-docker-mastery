Kubernetes will automatically mount the default service account to all created pods. A default service account is created in each new namespace but these have limited ability so you may neeed to create your own. You can see where the service account is mounted by describing the pod
'k create serviceaccount my-new-sa'

From version 1.24 of kubernetes service accounts no longer have a secret automatically created, you need to create a token for the sa
'k create token my-new-sa'
default expiry time is 1 hour for the token

However it is still possible to create a secret that doesn't expire but its not recommended (lecture 165)

Once the token is created for your SA, change your spec in the pod/deploy definition file to use the new SA. Once saved, the pod will be rotated (if part of a deployment or must be replaced if just a single pod) and if a role and rolebinding is configured for the SA, the SA will have permissions to what the role has (through RBAC)
