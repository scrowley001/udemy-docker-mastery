Taints and Tolerations
Tainting a node means no pod can be placed on that node unless it has been given a toleration in its definition.
There are 3 taint effects:
NoSchedule: no pods will be placed on the node
PreferedNoSchedule: it will try and avoid placing a pod on a node but its not guaranteed
NoExecute: no pods will be placed on teh node, and any existing pods will be removed

Just because a pod has a toleration, does not mean that pod will be scheduled on the node with a taint. It might be placed on a node that doesn't have a taint. If you need a pod to be on a particular node then this is the purpose of node affinity. 
Tains are automatically placed on master nodes when created to prevent any pods being placed on them by default

To taint a node = k taint node node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule
To untaint a node = k taint node node01 spray:NoSchedule-
To setup a toleration in a yaml file:
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

Affinity
To assign pods to nodes based on labels. Allows you to be more specific than nodeSelctor
affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
           requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                nodeSelectorTerms:
                    - matchExpressions:
                        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
                          operator: In
                          values:
                         -  minikube

(lecture 64) If you have a scenario where you only want you pods on certain nodes and another team only want their pods on their own nodes, then you could use a both taint/tolerations and node affinity

Annotations
Similar to labels but these are not used to group items. They are there purely for any extra info you would like to place on the item, e.g. build_version, phone number, git sha etc

Manual scheduling:
in your pod.yaml file you could have something like 'nodeName: node1' under the pod spec. This will look for a node with that name

Node selector:
similar to manual scheduling above, only this time you have something similar to below, only this works off of labels on the node and not the node name
'nodeSelector:
  size: Large'
