Affinity
To assign pods to nodes based on labels. Allows you to be more specific than nodeSelctor. The below example comes under the spec in the pod definition.
affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
           requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                nodeSelectorTerms:
                    - matchExpressions:
                        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
                          operator: In
                          values:
                         -  minikube

(lecture 64) If you have a scenario where you only want you pods on certain nodes and another team only want their pods on their own nodes, then you could use a both taint/tolerations and node affinity
